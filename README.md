Welcome to my personal algorithms repository, which I use to practice and hone my DS and Algorithm skills. Dive in to explore a collection of solutions and implementations spanning various problems, each crafted with efficiency, readability, and performance in mind. All practice problems are taken from Codewars and Leetcode.

## Structure
The repository is organized by programming language to make navigation and discovery as straightforward as possible. Each solution is self-contained, with Python solutions including built-in unittests to validate and exemplify **test-driven development**.

## Languages
Python: A collection of Python scripts, each solving a unique problem. Every Python solution includes unittests, showcasing not just solution implementation but also testing and validation.

TypeScript: Explore solutions implemented in TypeScript, bringing strong typing and modern JavaScript features to the algorithmic challenges.

## Getting Started
### Python
To run any Python script, simply navigate to the python directory and execute the script using a Python interpreter:
```
python3 <script_name>.py
```

Each script includes unittests to validate the solution, ensuring correctness and performance.

### TypeScript
For TypeScript, navigate to the typescript directory, and particularly into the subdirectories for specific solutions. Use the TypeScript compiler to compile the .ts files, and then execute them with Node.js.

Contribute
Feel free to fork this repository, explore the solutions, and propose improvements or even new challenges and solutions. All contributions are welcome!
