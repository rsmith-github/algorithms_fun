# Solution

- keep track of current max area
- two pointer while loop
- if left bar is lower or equal to right bar, calculate area and move left pointer
- if right bar is lower or equal to left bar, calculate area and move right pointer
- update max area

# Time / Space complexity
- Linear O(n)
- O(1)
